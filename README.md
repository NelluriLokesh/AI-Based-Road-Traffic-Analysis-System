## Overview
------------

This project utilizes advanced computer vision techniques and deep learning models to analyze road traffic in real-time. The system detects vehicles, counts them, and provides insights into traffic patterns, making it an essential tool for traffic management and urban planning.

### Key Benefits

* Real-time vehicle detection and counting
* Traffic visualization with annotated video feeds
* Output video with annotations for further analysis

## Features
------------

### Real-Time Vehicle Detection

* Leverages YOLOv5 for fast and accurate vehicle detection
* Supports various video formats and resolutions

### Vehicle Counting

* Counts vehicles passing a designated line in the video feed
* Provides accurate counting even in crowded scenes

### Traffic Visualization

* Displays annotated video feeds with detected vehicles
* Supports various annotation styles and colors

### Output Video

* Saves processed video with annotations for further analysis
* Supports various video formats and resolutions
